# Windows 11 Professional Preactivated 2024 Download


Windows 11Pro has an entirely new design. Microsoft needs a good reason to reverse its past claims and ditch Windows 10 by introducing a new operating system number. And a completely new design is excellent for that.

The central part of this announcement is a significant user interface change. We will borrow a significant portion of the UX changes from the Windows 10X shell, and Windows 10X is not coming to market.

Right angles will disappear. Fillets will replace them. In truth, insiders and concept designers disagree on this point - some are confident that Microsoft will not change its traditions and keep right angles. In contrast, others are convinced that Microsoft will follow the fashion for fillets.
